## About

Link Lock is a tool for encrypting and decrypting URLs. When a user visits an
encrypted URL, they will be prompted for a password. If the password is
correct, Link Lock retrieves the original URL and then redirects there.
Otherwise, an error is displayed. Users can also add hints to display near the
password prompt.

Each encrypted URL is stored entirely within the link generated by the
application. As a result, users control all the data they create with Link
Lock. Nothing is ever stored on a server, and there are no cookies, tracking,
or signups.
